## Properties
Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_machine_image` resource:


  * `kind`: [Output Only] The resource type, which is always compute#machineImage for machine image.

  * `id`: [Output Only] A unique identifier for this machine image. The server defines this identifier.

  * `creation_timestamp`: [Output Only] The creation timestamp for this machine image in RFC3339 text format.

  * `name`: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

  * `description`: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

  * `self_link`: [Output Only] The URL for this machine image. The server defines this URL.

  * `source_instance`: The source instance used to create the machine image. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are valid values: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone /instances/instance - projects/project/zones/zone/instances/instance

  * `status`: [Output Only] The status of the machine image. One of the following values: INVALID, CREATING, READY, DELETING, and UPLOADING.
  Possible values:
    * CREATING
    * DELETING
    * INVALID
    * READY
    * UPLOADING

  * `source_instance_properties`: DEPRECATED: Please use compute#instanceProperties instead. New properties will not be added to this field.

    * `description`: An optional text description for the instances that are created from this machine image.

    * `tags`: A set of instance tags.

      * `items`: An array of tags. Each tag must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.

      * `fingerprint`: Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the tags' contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update tags. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change tags. To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.

    * `machine_type`: The machine type to use for instances that are created from this machine image.

    * `can_ip_forward`: Enables instances created based on this machine image to send packets with source IP addresses other than their own and receive packets with destination IP addresses other than their own. If these instances will be used as an IP gateway or it will be set as the next-hop in a Route resource, specify true. If unsure, leave this set to false. See the Enable IP forwarding documentation for more information.

    * `network_interfaces`: An array of network access configurations for this interface.

      * `kind`: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#networkInterface for network interfaces.

      * `network`: URL of the VPC network resource for this instance. When creating an instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified, the default network global/networks/default is used. If the selected project doesn't have the default network, you must specify a network or subnet. If the network is not specified but the subnetwork is specified, the network is inferred. If you specify this property, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/networks/ network - projects/project/global/networks/network - global/networks/default

If the network is in auto subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is optional. If the network is in custom subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is required. If you specify this field, you can specify the subnetwork as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region /subnetworks/subnetwork - regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork

The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve the resource.

      * `items`: Array of key/value pairs. The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.

        * `key`: Key for the metadata entry. Keys must conform to the following regexp: [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+, and be less than 128 bytes in length. This is reflected as part of a URL in the metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not conflict with any other metadata keys for the project.

        * `value`: Value for the metadata entry. These are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed on values is that their size must be less than or equal to 262144 bytes (256 KiB).

    * `service_accounts`: A list of service accounts with specified scopes. Access tokens for these service accounts are available to the instances that are created from these properties. Use metadata queries to obtain the access tokens for these instances.

      * `scopes`: The list of scopes to be made available for this service account.

    * `scheduling`: Sets the scheduling options for an Instance.

By default, this is set to true so an instance is automatically restarted if it is terminated by Compute Engine.

      * `preemptible`: Defines whether the instance is preemptible. This can only be set during instance creation or while the instance is stopped and therefore, in a `TERMINATED` state. See Instance Life Cycle for more information on the possible instance states.

        * `seconds`: Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000 inclusive. Note: these bounds are computed from: 60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day * 365.25 days/year * 10000 years

        * `nanos`: Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
